# Hangman
a fun game that I wrote on Java using JavaFX

## About The Project

![Hangman-screenshot](/resource/hangman-screenshot.png)

I have created the minimalistic design of [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)) word game. In this game
the word to guess is represented by a row of question marks, representing each letter of the word. You win the game if you guess the word
in 10 turns. You lose otherwise. When you stop the game the game calculates your score: the number of wins and losses. In this window, you can clear the scores and start the game again. 

Words are randomly extracted from file words.txt. The file words.txt contains 120 words. When compiling words.txt, I used 4th grade English vocabulary: no informal words, literary words and names.    
### Built With
The game is written on Java using [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) platform.
